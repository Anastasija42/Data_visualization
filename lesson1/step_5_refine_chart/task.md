# Task: Test and Refine the Final Chart

In this step, you will enhance the bar chart generated in the previous step by adding labels, titles, and other enhancements. You will also explore the various attributes of the plot, experiment with them, and ultimately save the final version as an image file.

### Key Functions:
- `plt.title()`: Add a title to the chart.
- `plt.xlabel()`, `plt.ylabel()`: Label the x and y axes.
- `plt.legend()`: Create a legend for the chart.
- `plt.savefig()`: Save the chart as an image file.

### Objectives:
- Change titles and labels to the axes.
- Create a legend for better understanding.
- Save the final chart as an image file (`games_chart.png`).
