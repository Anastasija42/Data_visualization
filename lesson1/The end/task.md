**Congratulations on completing this lesson!** 

You've learned how to visualize gaming trends by creating a bar chart that displays the distribution of games across different platforms and genres. Here's a quick recap of what you've accomplished:

- Data Handling: You started by loading data from a CSV file and explored its structure using Pandas.
- Filtering Data: You filtered the dataset to focus on specific gaming platforms, ensuring your analysis was relevant.
- Data Aggregation: You aggregated the data by genre and platform to prepare it for visualization.
- Creating a Pivot Table: You learned how to create a pivot table to reshape the data for clearer analysis.
- Plotting: You utilized Matplotlib to create an informative and visually appealing bar chart, customizing it with colors, labels, and titles.
- Refining and Saving: Finally, you refined your chart for presentation quality and learned how to save it as an image file.

The whole code in one place is in the `main.py` script of this folder.
